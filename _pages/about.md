I am PostDoctoral researcher at the [Departement of Civil and Environemental Engineering](https://www.dica.polimi.it/) of the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

I focus my efforts in the understanding and modelling of phenomena related to both *theoretical and
applied mechanics*. My research interests mainly include *slender structures*, *periodic homogenization*, *constitutive modelling*, and *computational mechanics*.

On one hand I aspire to answer fundamental problems related to the mechanical behaviour of architectured and heterogeneous materials that may offer novel or unexpected global responses, such as wave attenuation and wave guiding capabilities or localization phenomena. 
On the other hand, I also look for solutions to more practical problems questioned by industrial collaborators.
